        <p>The fundamental nature of universe is cold and entropic whereas life is warm and orderly which is exact opposite of the universe. So in one sense we can say that life is anti-entropic in nature but if we go a little deep down the rabbit hole, we come to a realization that life is not actually against the entropy rather it feeds on the entropy. Microscopically speaking, genes are benefitted by each mutation and every new variation goes in the favour of life's ultimate mission aka the survival. Thus the entropic nature of genes is the reason for ballooning the gene pool.</p>
<p>In terms of macroscopic scale, man as a conscious being has advanced to this level thanks to entropy. Every new information causes an expansion of awareness. For instance every mistake mankind made was a lesson for next generation, may it be the world wars or ozone hole we learned something about mankind or about the nature and that in return helped us make improvement in us or our surrounding. Similarly discovery of new information has lead us to the modern age. Every entropic elements such as errors, variation etc expands our awareness and the expanded awareness enbales adaptation which again goes in the favour of life's ultimate mission i.e the survival.</p>
<p>This concept may seem counterintuitive, even nugatory to some but let me point out the fact that how we see life and universe has paramount efffect on how we behave and rationalize things around us. And closer our view to that of the actual features of life & universe, more accurate are our decisions and rationalization. For instance, universe is entropic i.e change is inevitable, if we accept this fact and stop avoiding change but find ways to not only accept but take advantage of change then we tend to be more successful. This can be realized from the point that life is pro-entropic in nature at the first place simply because universe is full of entropy.</p>
<p>Thus the crux of the essay is that life is not anti-entropic but rather pro-entropic in nature and for that reason we should also try to make our life pro-entroptic in nature. In fact what I reckon is that life could be define solely on the basis of entropy i.e life is anything that grows when feeded with randomness/ variation. The only game that life is willing to play is the survival game and although it seems like entropy is the opponent, it is actually the vangaurd of life.</p>
