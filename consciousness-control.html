          <p>Something that fascinates me is how closely consciousness resembles a control system, especially a closed-loop system. A control system produces a desired output by sensing what is happening, comparing it to a goal, and feeding that information back to correct its behavior. Consciousness often works the same way: it continuously gathers information from the world and the body, forms an internal picture of what is going on, and adjusts thoughts and actions to better match intentions.</p>
          <p>This perspective makes control theory a useful lens for understanding consciousness. Two ideas from control systems—observability and controllability—map naturally onto human experience. Observability is the ability to infer the internal state of a system from what can be measured. In consciousness, this is like awareness: noticing not only external events but also internal signals such as emotion, tension, fatigue, desire, and attention. When awareness is weak or distorted, the mind is effectively “measuring” the wrong variables, so it misunderstands its own state and reacts poorly.</p>
          <p>Controllability is the ability to steer a system’s state toward a goal using available inputs. In consciousness, this resembles rationality: the capacity to regulate impulses, choose actions aligned with long-term goals, and correct course when reality deviates from intention. Rationality is not just logic; it is self-governance under uncertainty and distraction.</p>
          <p>The key point is that awareness and rationality depend on each other. Awareness without rationality can feel like being flooded by signals with no ability to respond well, while rationality without awareness becomes rigid control based on incomplete information. When both are strong, the feedback loop becomes well-tuned: the mind estimates itself accurately and steers itself effectively. Seen this way, developing consciousness is less mysterious than it sounds—it is partly the work of improving what is noticed and improving how behavior is adjusted in response.</p>
